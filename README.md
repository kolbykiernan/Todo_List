## ðŸ‘‹ About the Project

This to-do list application is designed to help users manage tasks efficiently using an interactive and intuitive drag-and-drop interface. The project utilizes modern React libraries to provide a smooth user experience, featuring animations, task organization, and a user-friendly interface. Users can create, edit, and organize tasks across three different columns: "Todo," "In Progress," and "Done." This application also supports task prioritization, note-taking, and repeat scheduling, making it a comprehensive tool for managing tasks. This app is not mobile friendly at the moment.

## ðŸ“² Features
ðŸ‘‰ **Drag-and-Drop Interface:** Built with DnD Kit, allowing users to easily drag and drop tasks between columns to reflect their progress.

ðŸ‘‰ **Smooth Animations:** Implemented using Framer Motion and react-confetti to enhance user interactions and celebrate task completions with confetti animations.

ðŸ‘‰ **Three Organized Columns:** Tasks are organized into three columnsâ€”"Todo," "In Progress," and "Done"â€”with a counter indicating the number of tasks in each column.

ðŸ‘‰ **Task Creation:** Users can create new tasks, which are added to the "Todo" column by default.

ðŸ‘‰ **Task Editing:** Clicking on a task opens a detail view where users can:
  * Change the task name
  * Add or edit notes  
  * Set a priority level (Low, Medium, High)   
  * Define repeat settings (e.g., daily, weekly)    
  * Delete the task if it's no longer needed   

ðŸ‘‰ **Local Storage Integration:** All tasks and their details are saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring data persistence even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

ðŸ‘‰ **Confetti Celebration:** Moving a task to the "Done" column triggers a confetti animation to celebrate the accomplishment.
